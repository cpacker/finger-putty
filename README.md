<h3>Finger Putty</h3>

Finger Putty is an OS fingerprint spoofer that modifies the TCP/IP stack to alter outgoing packets and defeat Nmap fingerprinting.
Launching the program using the start.sh file will also give your computer a temporary MAC address and launch Chrome with a user agent matching your Nmap fingerprint.

Development still in progress - use at your own risk.

For use on OSX 10.8

Planned features:
  Additional profiles (Windows 8, Playstation/Xbox, Android)

Known issues:
  Spoofed user agent OS and Nmap fingerprint OS don't dynamically match
